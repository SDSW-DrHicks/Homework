# Homework 2: Plots and functions
#-----------------------------------------------------
# 20 points total (1 point = 5% of grade)
# This assignment will count as a "Journal" grade.
# You may use class notes or visit office hours.
# You cannot work on this assignment as a group.

# For each question, use the comment symbol (#) to explain the code.
# Only one or 2 sentences are necessary. This is important for partial credit.
# No comments, no credit.
#-----------------------------------------------------

# Problem 1:
# Import matplotlib and numpy
# (2 points)
# -------
# Use this space to write code for problem 1.
#--------

# Problem 2a:
# For the function: y = x**2+3*x+1
# Write a function code (using "def") to take a user-input value
# of "x" and print the solution 'y.'
# (5 points)
#--------
# Use this space to write code for problem 2a.
#--------

# Problem 2b:
# Use the pyplot feature of matplotlib to generate
# a plot of the above function (from 2b) for values of 'x'
# from [-15,15].
# (3 points)
#--------
# Use this space to write code for problem 2b.
#--------

# Problem 3:
# The following equation is used to track the change in
# the concentration of a reactive substance (A) in the chemical reaction:
# A + A -> P. The equation is:
# (1/[A])=(1/[A0])+k*t
# where [A] is the concentration of substance A (mol/L)
# where [A0] is the initial concentration of A when the reaction starts (mol/L)
# where "k" is the reaction rate constant. Use a value of 0.15 (units: 1/s)
# where "t" is time, in seconds.

# Write a function to calculate the value of 1/[A] over the course of
# 5 minutes if the initial concentration of A is 2 mol/L.

# (10 points)
