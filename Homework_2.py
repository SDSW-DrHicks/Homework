# Problem 2a:
# For the function: y = x**2+3*x+1
# Write a function code (using "def") to take a user-input value
# of "x" and print the solution 'y.'
# (5 points)
#--------
# Use this space to write code for problem 2a.

# Problem 2b:
# Use the pyplot feature of matplotlib to generate
# a plot of the above function (from 2b) for values of 'x'
# from [-15,15].
# (3 points)
#--------
# Use this space to write code for problem 2b.
